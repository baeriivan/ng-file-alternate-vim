# ng-file-alternate.vim

Vim plugin to allow easy swap between component files {html,ts,spec.ts,css}.

## Usage

Currently, the shortcuts for swaping files are hard-coded into:

- `<leader>hh` : Go to HTML file (.html)
- `<leader>jj` : Go to script file (.ts)
- `<leader>kk` : Go to test file (.spec.ts)
- `<leader>ll` : Go to style file (.css)

Note: This is only a **draft**.
